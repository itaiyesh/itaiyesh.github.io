    <h1 class="my-4 mt-5">Emergent Behaviors from a Large-Scale Life Simulation</h1>

    <p class="mt-5">
      We simulate an environment with up to 2,000 agents, each modelled by a separate neural network.

    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      We allow the agents to communicate via direct (signals and messages) and indirect (phenotype viewing) means.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      From a complete random generation of weights early in the simulation, basic maneuvering skills emerge
      and later, complex behaviors and iteractions evolve.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      We collect and explore some of the emergent behaviors from our simulations.

    </p>

    <br>

    <!-- <hr> -->
    <h2 class="section">Terrain</h2>
    <p> The terrain is made of land (gray) and sea (blue).
      The land areas are randomly generated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise"> Perlin
        Noise</a>.
      The energy sources can only be found on land.
      In addition, the sea area is harmful to the living cells.

    </p>
    <p class="mt-5 mb-5">The creation of a non-homogenous environment with separate territories would encourage more
      diverse
      behaviors and speciation, as we will later see.</p>

    <h2 class="section">Energy Source</h2>
    <p class="mt-5"> An energy source is a circular object with radius proportional to its energy level.
      When a cell touches it, it may choose to consume its energy, thereby decreasing its size.</p>

    <p class="mt-5">Energy sources are scattered
      uniformly on land.</p>
    <!-- <hr> -->
    <h2 class="section">Cell</h2>
    <p class="mb-5"> A cell is a living creature, capable of moving, feeding and reproducing.
      In addition, a cell is capable of communicating with other cells on which we elaborate later. </p>
    <p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        A cell's size signifies the amount of energy that it has. A cell with a higher energy level can survive longer
        without food and may inflict more damage on other cells.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        Above a certain size threshold, a cell may also have the ability to reproduce via sexual reproduction.
      </p>

      <p>
        We define a cell <strong>phenotype</strong> as a portion of its genome, or more
        technically, a fixed area from the weights of its neural network.
        <div class="alert alert-info fade show">
          The cell colors in our illustrations are derived from their phenotypes: We reduce the dimensionality of the
          phenotypes to 3-dimensional vectors and scale each axis to a [0, 255] range, denoting RGB colors.

      <h2 class="section">Model</h2>
      <p>At the heart of each cell is a gated recursive unit, or GRU, followed by a feed forward layer. </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Its output is a set of independent actions on other cells or on the environment:
        A vector of <strong>acceleration</strong>, boolean flags indicating whether it wants to <strong>mate</strong>,
        <strong>attack</strong> and <strong>feed</strong>, and a free <strong>message</strong> that it wishes to
        broadcast to other, nearby cells.
        <!-- In addition, the cells can view each other's <strong>phenotype</strong>. -->
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Its input is more involved and encapsulates information from the cell's current state, as well as the state of
        nearby cells and energy sources.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
        The cells have a limited receptive <i>range</i>: They cannot detect other cells and energy sources beyond this
        range.
        In addition, they have a limited receptive <i>field</i>. That is, they can only detect <em>k</em> cells/energy
        sources at once and always prefer to choose the closest.
      </p>

      <figure class="text-center">
        <img src="resources/receptive_field.png" style="width:60%;">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right pt-4"> A cell's (purple) receptive range of 50 units and receptive
          field of 2 cells maximum. Cells outside the receptive field (translucent) are invisible to the cell in the
          center.</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p class="mt-5">
        In summary, the cell input includes: the cell current <strong>acceleration</strong> vector, whether it is in
        <strong>sea</strong> or not, and its current <strong>energy</strong> level.<br>
        Then, for each other cell <em>i</em> within its receptive range and field, a <strong>valid</strong> flag
        indicating whether there is indeed a cell within range (otherwise, all attributes concerning the i<sup>th</sup>
        cell are trash and should be neglected),
        the <strong>direction</strong> to the i<sup>th</sup> cell, the <strong>distance</strong> from it, the
        <strong>message</strong> coming from that cell, its <strong>phenotype</strong> and its <strong>energy</strong>
        level.
        <div class="alert alert-info fade show">
          <strong>Valid flag:</strong> Since the dimensionality of the input must remain fixed for the neural network,
          fields must be populated even when data is absent.
          The valid flag allows the cell to distinguish between input that depicts an
          actual entity in-sight and input that should be ignored.
        </div>
        Likewise, for each energy source <em>j</em> within its receptive range and field, there is a flag indicating
        whether the data is <strong>valid</strong> (<em>i.e.</em>, the energy source is in range),
        the <strong>direction</strong> and <strong>distance</strong> to that energy source.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Increasing the receptvie range and field increases the complexity of the observation space by a great amount.
        Therefore, in our experiments we limit the receptive field to 2 cells and 2 energy sources (two separate
        receptive
        fields).

      </p>

      <p class="mt-5  mb-5"> The following diagram summarizes a single cell's neural network, its input and output, in a
        single time step.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="resources/bacteria_model.png" style="width:100%">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">A cell's model in time step <em>i+1</em>. The dimensions allocated
          to each feature are
          designated in the respective boxes. (GRU's hidden dim = 32).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="mt-5">
        In many reinforcement learning problems the actor uses a Markovian decision process, where a single state can be
        used to model all future environment interactions.
        In such situations, past states are useless as they don't tell us anymore than what the current state
        does.<br></p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        Since in our large-scale multi-agent simulation, environment is only partially known to each cell and changes
        very often as cells enter and
        leave each other's receptive fields,
        neglecting knowledge from previous states would result in
        spasmodic movement by the agents.<br>
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">

        Rather, we find that using a previous hidden state aids the cells adapt a coherent movement and behavior, and
        allows a
        cell to
        preserve intention
        from one time step to the next. <br>
      </p>

      <h2 class="section">Feeding</h2>
      <p class="mt-5">In order for a cell to feed, it must be within touching radius of the energy source and light up
        its <strong>feed</strong> flag at the same time.

        <div class="alert alert-info fade show">
          A cut-off threshold is used to detect whether a flag in a cell output (such as feed, attack or mate) is lit or
          not
        </div>
        <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
          Since each cell has a maximum size limit, it may choose not to consume a source if its own energy is at
          maximum,
          and spare it for later use or for others. </p>

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section">Attacking</h2>
    <p>A cell has the ability to inflict damage upon other cells by lighting its <strong>attack</strong> flag when
      touching them. An attack event causes the victim to lose a great amount of energy, yet it also requires the
      attacker
      to spend some energy. </p>

    <p class="mt-5">In a fight to the death, the cell with the higher energy level is more likely to survive as it has
      more energy to spend on attacks and more energy to withstand an attack. As a result, in our observations, smaller
      cells tend to avoid larger cells.</p>

    <h2 class="section">Reproduction</h2>
    <p> The cells employ a sexual reproduction as their evolutionary strategy.

    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      When the sum of two cells' energy levels passes a certain threshold, they are allowed to mate.
      However, for mating to take place, the two cells must also touch and light their <strong>mating</strong> flags at
      the same time.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      A single mating event results in the production of a single offspring whose neural network weights are an
      average of the weights of its two parents, with the addition of noise.
      Thus, the resulting offspring's traits and behaviors are somewhat similar to its parents', but may also exhibit
      novel
      behaviors due to "mutations".
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      In pratice, cells often mate with the same partner more than once in a short period of time, which results in
      numerous offsprings.
    </p>

  </figure>

  <div class="container">
    <p class="mt-5">
      Cells also lose energy following a reproduction, which enforces a limit on the number of matings they can do in a
      single episode. <br>


    </p>

    <h2 class="section">Simulation</h2>

    <p class="mb-5">
      In each time step, the energy level of each cell is decreased by a constant so that cells must pro-actively
      acquire more energy in order to survive and cannot remain idle.
      When accelerating, cells also lose more energy that is proportional to their acceleration.
      Thus, cells must use their energy resource wisely, and only predetermined actions are encouraged.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-5">
      A world is defined by an <em>N x N</em> grid, where <em>N</em> is initially small and increases with the cells
      average generation.
      The total energy in the world remains constant and is proportional to <em>N</em>.
      The sum of all energy sources together with the sum of all cell energies, cannot exceed that level.

    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info fade show">
      Having a constant energy creates a tradeoff between the number of creatures in the world, and their level of
      sophistication. For
      example, in the initial phases, the world contains relatively more cells compared to later phases,
      however, they are also much smaller as they are inapt in acquiring food.
    </div>

    <p class="mt-5">
      In each time step, we calculate the amount of new offspring that need to be added to the world (i.e., as a result
      of mating events).
      If this level reaches below the world capacity, we fill the remaining capacity by adding cells at random
      positions, having randomly initialized
      weights.
      Otherwise, if the world is at a maximum capacity, we evict cells with the lowest energy levels, making room for
      the
      new
      offsprings.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      However, when a cell's energy level passes a certain threshold, it cannot be evicted.
      In the extreme case when the world is at a maximum capacity and all cells are above that threshold, no new
      offpsrings can be made.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      The total mass of the energy resources is also bound by the world capacity limit.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section">World Expansion</h2>

    <p>

      We denote the <strong>generation</strong> of each cell as its depth in the lineage tree where the root ancestor
      was randomly generated. Thus, each randomly generated cell is a 1<sup>st</sup> generation, it's first offspring
      is 2<sup>nd</sup> generation, etc...

    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      The generation can attest to the quality of a cell such that greater generations are expected to be more
      sophisticated.

      When the average generation of all cells reach a certain level, the world is expanded and its energy constant is
      increased proportionally.
      Consequently, more cells and energy sources can be generated, and cells have a larger inhabitant.

    </p>
    <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
      After an expansion, the threshold generation for the next expansion is updated accordingly.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <div class="video-container">
        <video width="100%" autoplay id="mate-video" src="resources/world_expansion.mkv" type="video/mp4"

      </div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right pr-5">A series of world expansions.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div class="alert alert-info fade show">
      In our simulations, expansions are separated by a few thousands generations (i.e, 3k generations between two
      consecutive expansions). We begin with a world of size 50 units and progress
      to a maximum world of size 1,500 units, which contains 2,000 cells.
    </div>

    <p class="mt-5">
      The world expansion is dual-purpose in this case: First, it lets us run more simulation steps in the early phases
      of training, in a shorter period
      of time since the world is smaller and less entities are involved in the physics computation.
      Second, it establishes a sort-of curiculum-learning, where cells initially master basic movement and later exhibit
      more elaborate behavior as the environment becomes larger and interactions diversify. <br>
    </p>



    <p class="mb-5">
      As we will soon see, in the early phases, cells focus is on mastering basic movement and maneuvering in order to
      reach energy
      sources, and later phases include speciation and communication with other cells.

    <h2 class="section">Speciation</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">
      The creation of inhabitable (land) and uninhabitable (sea) areas, make it harder for the cells to emmigrate from one
      place to another. This allows cells to develop separate
      genetic pools, each undergoing further evolutionary steps somewhat isolated from the other.

    <p class="mb-5">

      Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the simulation is how cells learn to communicate.
      We recall that cells have four type of signals to communicate with: mate, attack, feed and a free message.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
      To illustrate the variability in communication, we perform a clustering of the cell free messages collected from a
      single time step, and reduce them using a PCA
      followed by
      T-<em>SNE</em>.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="resources/messages.png" style="width:100%">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">Clustering of cell messages from a single time-step. (Median generation = 15k.
        We used a silhouette score to find the best number of clusters under KMeans. Using
        PCA followed by T-SNE; perplexity=70, for visualization).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="mt-5">
      An obvious next step would have been to plug each centroid from the message clusters
      into the cells and observe their behaviors in order to learn the meaning of those messages.
      However, since messages are scenario and species dependent, such a task is not so straight-forward.

    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Instead, we show two simpler examples, where we force a cell to broadcast two signals: attack and feed.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      In each of the following two examples, we pin the cell in the middle (pink) in-place and force it to broadcast a
      message of
      our choice. The second cell (blue)
      is free to move and broadcast whatever message it chooses. The two examples involve the exact same cells, and the
      exact same initial settings. The only thing that differs is the message that the pink cell broadcasts.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
      In the following illustration, we force the pink cell to broadcast an <strong>attack</strong> signal, making the blue cell
      engulf it in reach for the energy source.

    <h2 class="my-4">Conclusion</h2>


    <p class="mt-5">
      <a href=https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies />Evolutionary Strategy</a> has been recently shown to
      compete
      with standard reinforcement learning algorithms on
      a set of Atari games having single or few agents. This often involves the collection of separate game trajectories
      over multiple processes, by agents residing in separate, isolated environments.
    </p>
    <!-- These methods are often limited by the variability of the -->

    <p class="mt-5">
      In our simulation on the other hand, all agents live in the same world, which increases variability and diversity
      of
      interactions.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      We use evolutionary strategy to train the models but delegate the decision on reproduction to the involved
      individuals themselves. Thus, the reproduction process itself is subject to evolution.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      We have obtained a variety of rudimentary forms of communication by simulating the process of natural selection in
      a large-scale, multi-agent environment.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      An extension of this work may choose to employ a variety of other models as the cell state-machine. In
      particular,
      it would be interesting
      to explore the addition of attention layers on top of our neural network architecture.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
      A further study may wish to integrate more complex tasks in the environment: for instance, such that require
      cooperation and team-work by the agents.

    </p class="mt-5">
    <h2 class="section">Technical details</h2>
    <p>
      Simulations were done on a single thread, single CPU (Intel i7). Reaching a 20k generation took approximately 30 hours.
      (GPU is also supported however, performs much slower).
